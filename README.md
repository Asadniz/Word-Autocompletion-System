# Word-Autocompletion-System
This is a frequency based skeleton-model of a word autocompletion-system, done in collaboration with Abdullah (ID: ). The system has been implemented with AVL trees in Python. Prefix-match and frequency count have been used as the filtering methods. Contributions can be added to add more filter methods and make the code more efficient.
